## About Me

I am a Product Manager focused on boosting user engagement, expanding the user base, and minimizing CAC for B2C/B2B products, mostly AI-based. In the last 12 months, I have developed 18 AI applications (freelancing) with a 4-year background in carrying products from conception to production. I have led teams of up to 50 members and have extensive experience in product development and growth loops.
